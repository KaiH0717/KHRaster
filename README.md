# KHRaster

This is a rasterizer written during my student time at my university.

# Features

- Real-time rasterizer
- Bit blit onto different region of the application window
- Rasterizes points, lines, and triangles
- Texturing based on texture coordinates
- Real-time rendering of 3D triangular geometry with simple lighting

# Build

- Visual Studio 2019
- C++ 20

All of the required libraries should be included in the repository, the only thing needs to be done is to initialize the submodules
